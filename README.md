# PyWeather
A Pygame based weather display program that is easily customizable.  The program is designed to display current weather from local sensors, but can easily display info from Wunderground's API.  The forecast data is taken from Wunderground's API.  You will need an API key from Wunderground.  The current settings allow the user to use the free tier of the API, without going over the request limit.

Place the API key in a file titled api.py and exclude it from any public git repos by adding it to your .gitignore.

You will need to install Pygame in your Python3 library.  The best way to do this is with pip3 install pygame.  The json and requests library should already be in your Python3 standard libraries.

All artwork, except the weather station icon and wifi-status bars, are original artwork.  You are free to use them in any way you see fit.  I will eventually upload the illustrator source file I used to draw them.  The other images are taken from freely available royalty-free sources.
